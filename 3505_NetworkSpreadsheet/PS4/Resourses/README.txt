The spreadsheet I plan on using both my formula class and my dependency graph
it will be backed by the dependency graph and formula will be passed as a parameter for setting 
the cells with said formulas. It will also be backed by a dictionary that will hold the cells, the keys
will be the names of the said cells.

The GUI's additional feature is that arrow keys can be used to move around to different cells in the spreadsheet. 
When an arrow key is used to move to a new cell, that cell's contents and value are displayed in the boxes 
above the grid. Also, the old cell's value is set into the grid.
If a formula is entered that relies on another cell, but that cell does not have a numerical value, an error message 
is displyed in the formula cell. However, all formula cells are updated when the cells that they depend on are updated.
